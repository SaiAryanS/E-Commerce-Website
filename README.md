# The Home Office Kit - 3-Tier E-Commerce Application

This is a complete, functional, 3-tier e-commerce web application built with Angular, Express.js, and MySQL.

## Running with Docker (Recommended)

With Docker and Docker Compose, you can run the entire application with a single command.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
    *   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

2.  **Run the Application:**
    *   You can use the `.env` file in the `backend` directory to configure your application. If you don't, the application will use default values.
    *   Open a terminal in the project root directory (the one containing the `docker-compose.yml` file).
    *   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d --build
        ```
    *   This will build the images for the frontend and backend, start the containers, and set up the database.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   **Website:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`.
    *   **Backend API:** The API is available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   **Database:** The MySQL database is exposed on port `3307`.

4.  **Stopping the Application:**
    *   To stop the running containers, execute:
        ```bash
        docker-compose down
        ```

## Setup and Installation Guide

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your machine.
2.  Log in to your MySQL server and create the database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE home_office_kit_db;
    ```

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  Open the `.env` file and update the following variables with your credentials:
    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_mysql_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=home_office_kit_db

    JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_secret_key

    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=a_secure_password
    ```
4.  Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the Angular development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the application.
